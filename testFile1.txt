Branch B

Edit - 1

Adding new stuff to test Merge and Rebase. First, merge.

Merge done. Now let's try Rebase. Let's see how the Network graph looks like. This is the first adding to the code, to create a new commit to Branch B. I'll create another commit after this, so that we can see how to commits are updated to master branch in rebase.

commit-2 for rebase.
